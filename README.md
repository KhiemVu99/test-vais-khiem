My Tasks

## Getting Started

This project is a candidate assessment test for the Mobile Developer position at Vais company.
To install the project, please clone the code from the following GitHub link: https://github.com/KhiemVu99/test-vais-khiem.git.
Then open the file using Android Studio with Flutter and Flutter SDK plugins installed.
Then run the following commands to run your app:

```bash
  flutter pub get
  open -a simulator (to get Android Simulator)
  flutter run
```

## Features

The project includes the following features:
- App Bar
- Task Input
- Alert box (optional feature) - Note: This feature has been removed because if there are multiple tasks expired before one day, multiple warnings will occur. Therefore, I replaced it with a warning image displayed on each task bar when the task expires before one day.
- Pin task (optional feature)
- Task List.
- Delete Action.
- Filter Options.
- Persistence (optional feature).
- Theme Toggle.
- Empty State.
- Error Handling.
- Use Bloc in source code
